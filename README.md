# Overview

Media Library is an Android app for keeping track of your physical media. Using a SQLite database,
you can store information about all your media. At the moment, only books are implemented.
To add a book, simply click the FAB at the bottom and enter the book's information. You can view
a books information by tapping on the books cover on the main page.
